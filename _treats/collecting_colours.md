The most enduring way to make eye well-being part of your daily life is to make it fun and engaging.
Collecting colours is leading to looking at your surroundings with new **interest** and the **excitement of a child**.

**Choose a colour** in the morning. Get inspired by your wardrobe, photographs or paintings at your walls. Just go with one that you instinctively like without over thinking it.

Look around you, as you go about your life. This is great whenever you are safe to do so - for example during your commute on the bus or when walking down the road or in a park. Acknowledge all the different colours you notice.

Look at this autumn picture and surround the orange area of the pumpkin. Remember that your eyes act like a paint brush that follows the orange shape as if you are a painter and mark the area that you want to fill orange.

The following picture shows a white outline to indicate how surrounding the orange of the pumpkin would look like. Notice that in this example it is not just one pumpkin shaped area. Instead, the line swirls along all the details where the pumpkin is overlayed by grass and the red leaf.
