You already know one of the best ways to relax your eyes.

- Stretch in all directions like are just awakening
- Take a good hearty yawn. Yawning without stifle is one of the best techniques to relax your eyes. So we will call it therapeutic yawning and from now on you may do it as often as you feel like it! Don't suppress it, but welcome it.
- Why? Yawning opens energy gates from the neck to the eyes, stimulates the tear fluid and provides increased oxygen levels. This way it really helps to awaken ourselves. Also great to loosen up tight jaw
- It is a perfect habit to start the day with a good yawn. It helps you to get up and you already granted your eyes something beneficial early in the morning
- It is sad that it is such a taboo and one of told off for doing so from young age. Involuntary yawning is a sign for a lack of oxygen, not a lack of interest. The body signals the wish to improve this.
