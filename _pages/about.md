## About Friederike Wild

[comment]: <> (TODO: Add a nice photo plus a header?)

Born 1983 in Germany, I studied computer science and proceeded a career as mobile developer for over 8 years. I therefore know first hand how full-time working in front of the computer and using your mobile effects and exhausts your eyes.


The fascination for eye therapy training started when discovering, that it can be a way away from depending on strong contact lenses and glasses for my short-sightedness. Wearing glasses had weakened my eyes over the years and my last contact lenses prescription was -7 dioptre on both eyes. I'm still on my own journey to completely regain my vision, but already I can tell how beneficial the routine is.


I would love to be your coach for eye wellbeing and help you to learn to relax and improve your eyes as well. 


My second passion is around discovering and creating delicious vegan food. Research suggests that a plant-based diet based around fresh vegetables and fruits packed with vitamins is beneficial to activate your self-healing powers. Why not give it a try with my collection of [veganised recipes](http://veganised.co.uk "veganised recipes").
