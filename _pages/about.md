Born 1983 in Germany, I studied computer science and I've proceeded a career as mobile developer for over 8 years. I therefore know first-hand how full-time work in front of the computer and excessive use of your mobile can effect and exhaust your eyes.


My fascination for eye therapy training started when I discovered that it offers an alternative to depending on strong contact lenses and glasses for my short-sightedness. Wearing glasses had weakened my eyes over the years and my last contact lenses prescription was -7 dioptre on both eyes. I'm still on my own journey to completely regain my vision, but already I can tell how beneficial a daily eye wellbeing routine is.


I currently study in Germany with renowned vision teacher [Wolfgang HÃ¤tscher-Rosenbauer](http://institut-fuer-sehtraining.de/) and I will complete my teacher training in September 2016.


I would love to be your coach for eye wellbeing and help you to learn to relax and discover your eyes' full potential.

My second passion is discovering and creating delicious vegan food. Research suggests that a plant-based diet based on fresh vegetables and fruits packed with vitamins is beneficial to activate your self-healing powers. Why not give it a try with my collection of [veganised recipes](http://veganised.co.uk "veganised recipes").
