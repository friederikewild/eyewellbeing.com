Yoga, Meditation, Fitness classes, Spa -- they all have in common, that they can help you to find a balance from todays hectic lifes. By dedicating me-time for such activities you improve your sense of well-being.
So we agree that nourishing your body and your mind are important. But what about your eyes?

Today more then ever good vision is in great demand in our day-to-day routine at work and in our freetime. 
Think about everything your vision allows you to do: use a computer, read a good book, enjoy a sunset, drive a car, look at your loved ones and generally navigate around in the world easily.

Unfortunately we often take our vision for granted. When the body starts to signal that we strain our eyes with aching eyes and headaches we tend to ignore it. Only once the vision decreases and prevents us to keep going, we visit an ophthalmologist. Unfortunately most do not know about holistic health. Prescribing glasses or contacts is a quick aid. But it does not cure the underlying issues. Instead it invites the eyes to become lazy and with time the vision gets worth and the prescriptions increase.

Eye Wellbeing is not a quick fix like put on glasses or get a laser eye surgery. Instead it offers you to relearn how to use your eyes without straining them and even more important how to relax them. 
You will learn techniques and small fun eye yoga exercises to integrate into your day-to-day life. 


The program aims to maintain healthy sight and prevent impaired vision. With time it can improve many different types of vision disorders naturally.
