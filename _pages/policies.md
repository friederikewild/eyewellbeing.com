My goal is to inform interested readers, like you, about natural ways to improve and maintain your eye well-being. I also offer you my help on your own journey if you wish the support of a coach. 

I am not a medical doctor. This site and the information it contains is based on my own journey and is shared for educational and informational purposes only. You may not sue me for following anything that is written on this site. 

The information and advice provided on my blog are of a general nature and should never replace individual health advice provided by your healthcare professional team.

## Privacy Policy

This privacy policy sets out how EyeWellbeing.com uses and protects any information that you give EyeWellbeing.com when you use this website.

EyeWellbeing.com is committed to ensuring that your privacy is protected. Should we ask you to provide certain information by which you can be identified when using this website, then you can be assured that it will only be used in accordance with this privacy statement.

### Consent

By using our website, you consent to the collection and use of your personal information by EyeWellbeing.com. If we decide to change our Privacy Policy, we will post those changes on this page so that you are always aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances we disclose it. You are under no obligation to provide us with your personal information. If you choose to do so, it will be accepted as your consent for us to collect and use it as described below. If you do supply your personal information, or if you allow us to obtain it from you by the methods described below, we will treat your information as confidential in accordance with this Privacy Policy.

### What We Do With the Information We Gather

We require this information to understand your needs and provide you with a better service, and in particular for the following reasons:

* Internal record keeping
* We may use the information to improve our products and services
* We may periodically send promotional emails about new products, special offers or other information which we think you may find interesting using the email address which you have provided
* From time to time, we may also use your information to contact you for market research purposes. We may contact you by email, telephone or mail. We may use the information to customise the website according to your interests

We will not direct market to anyone unless they have been given an opportunity to opt out of receiving future direct marketing communications.

However, if we contact you for the purpose of direct marketing, without having obtained your consent first, because it is impracticable for us to do so, we will at that time provide you with the opportunity to decline any further marketing communications at no cost to you.

You acknowledge and agree that we may disclose your personal information to organisations outside of EyeWellbeing.com.

Overall, cookies help us provide you with a better website, by enabling us to monitor which pages you find useful and which you do not. A cookie in no way gives us access to your computer or any information about you, other than the data you choose to share with us.

You can choose to accept or decline cookies. Most web browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can usually modify your browser setting to decline cookies if you prefer. This may prevent you from taking full advantage of the website.
