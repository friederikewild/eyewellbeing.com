Thank you for your interest in improving your Eye Wellbeing with me.

The aim is to prevent or reduce eye fatigue and vision stress which appear with symptoms such as

* Headaches
* Dry, tired, itching and/or burning eyes
* Fading eye sight
* Increased sensitivity to light

These symptoms can decrease your productivity and your happiness at work and in your daily life. Therefore, making simple precautions can improve your wellbeing significantly and not only for your eyes. Working with the computer will feel easier as well with relaxed and refreshed eyes.
