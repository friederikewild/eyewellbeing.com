Thank you for your interest in improving your Eye Wellbeing with me.

The aim is to prevent or reduce eye fatigue and vision stress which appear with symptoms such as

* Headaches
* Dry, tired, itching and/or burning eyes
* Fading eye sight
* Increased sensitivity to light

These symptoms can decrease your productivity and your happiness at work and in your daily life. Therefore, making simple precautions can improve your wellbeing significantly and not only for your eyes. Working with the computer will feel easier as well with relaxed and refreshed eyes.


### I currently offer in London:

* Workplace workshops
* Introduction workshops
* Individual or group course of 8 modules (each 90 minutes)

The one-hour workshop offers an overview to the topic as well as useful tips and short habits to integrate into your daily routine.
The full course consists of 8 modules, each focusing in depth on different aspects of our vision. Many exercises will illustrate and bring the information to life in a fun way! 


Eye wellness is suitable for everyone who wants to maintain a healthy sight and learn how to prevent or improve vision disorders naturally. 

Please wear comfortable clothes and bring along your contact lens container and/or your spectacle case.
Teaching is offered in English or German.

If you would like to know more, please contact me via [coach(at)friederikewild.me](mailto:{{ author.email }}) for further details.
