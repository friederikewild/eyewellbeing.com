*Day Two* started well. At first I was a bit tired, but the morning wake up routine did its job to get me starting the day. Going outdoors for the following morning routine was lovely today since I was greeted by lovely sunshine. I was even later then yesterday and so focussing the distance was again very difficult for me and I could not do it for long. 

But since the sun was out the following sun bathing felt great. I did two rounds. In the second I included shadow games which look to the closed eyes like an explosion of colours. I agree with my fellow students that this is one of my favourite eye exercises. So if you think of giving this course programme a go - this one is an experience to look forward to. 

I am thinking of replanning my day a bit to squeeze the morning routine in before making breakfast. My light sensitivity has already improved since March when I started to include the sun bathing on an unregular basis. But with the horizon focussing I am still at the beginning of my eyes getting used to this again. I hope to see improvement on this soon, but till then I really need to catch earlier and weaker sunshine. Especially since we are still having spring and summer will bring even brighter days.
