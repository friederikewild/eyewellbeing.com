### Where am I standing now?

My last eye examination was over a year ago, before I discovered the eye wellness programme. I mostly wear contact lenses, but I will include both glasses and contact lenses values to be able to see a full comparison.
 

#### Last glasses prescription

Starting from this I already swapped to wearing weaker contact lenses. You can get those online without a prescription and even in some drugstores. I bought in one go lenses in 0.75 steps from where I stood down to xx

I wish I had documented these stages, but roughly I first swapped in February 2015 to contact lenses of xx. In the beginning the blurry vision in the distance wasn't easy to deal with, but I think after a week I was fully used to it. Since most days are spend walking the same roads and rooms, it is way more easy to navigate than I first had anticipated.

Once I noticed seeing better again, I moved down another step to xx. From there it took me roughly another half a year. Then after quitting my job to fully focus on my eye coaching and my own health I noticed on a couple of days that I could read signs in the underground accross the aisle again. Time to challenge my eyes once more - which is where I am now wearing contact lenses with xx.

When you start this experiment I realise now, that it is really useful to take notes on observations. I find it easist to check my eyes on a regular schedule by observing signs during your commute. This way you will have them in front of you as a reminder to check what you see. You will notice that even during one day the signs can be more or less blurred or readable. This is totally normal, since our vision is actually not as fixed as glass prescriptions want to make us believe. By using weaker glasses you are not automatically regain your vision without additional time spend on relaxation and training, but you give your eyes tolerance to swing with the mood again between better and worth.


### Word of warning

I only allow myself wearing the weaker contact lenses on days when I do not drive a car or bicycle! Fortunately those are most of my days. Participating in road traffic needs your full vision and limiting it would endanger yourself and others!
