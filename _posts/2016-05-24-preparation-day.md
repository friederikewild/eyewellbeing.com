Today is all about setting up this website to be able to better document my personal eye improvement journey. 

This morning I woke up late for my first appointment of the day which led to not having as much time for my morning routine. I still managed to squeeze in a short sunbathing sequence.

During a bus ride I took advantage of sitting in the front row and did some near-far focus shifting. It's not ideal through a window, but I think it is better to do it in compromised form opposite to not at all.

In the late afternoon the sunshine wooed me outside to do another set of sunbathing which felt really good.


**Learning:** Plan your day ahead and include free time-slots of dedicated time for your eye wellbeing. Your future self will thank you! But also do not beat yourself up, when you miss a planned session. Instead set a new intention and be grateful for each time you take aside to focus on your eyes.
